After do that you can run the local server using :

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will lunch in your browser automatically.

### `npm test`

## Next steps
1) Implement more methods in the API to move some logic like the pagination.

2) Improved user interface design: Developing a more attractive and user-friendly interface would improve the user
   experience and increase adoption of the application. Example Chakra UI, Bootstrap, Material UI...

3) Increase the code coverage, creating more test for all the components
